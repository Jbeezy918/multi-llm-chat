Subject: Welcome to Multi-LLM Chat - Here's how to save 90% on AI costs

Hi [Name],

Thanks for trying Multi-LLM Chat! You just took the first step toward smarter AI usage.

🎯 Quick Start Guide

Here's how to get the most value:

1. Add Your API Keys (or use free Ollama)
   → Sidebar → Add keys for OpenAI, Claude, or Gemini
   → Or skip this entirely and use free local models

2. Ask Your First Question
   → Type anything in the chat box
   → Click "Ask All LLMs"
   → See responses from 4+ models instantly

3. Check Your Costs
   → Sidebar shows real-time spending
   → See which models are cheapest for your use case

💡 Pro Tip: Save 90% on AI Costs

Most users overpay for AI by using expensive models when cheaper ones work just as well.

Example:
- GPT-4 Turbo: $30 per 1M output tokens
- GPT-4o-mini: $0.60 per 1M output tokens (50x cheaper!)

Use Multi-LLM Chat to find the perfect balance of quality and cost.

Subject: This one tip could save you $50/month on AI

Hi [Name],

I analyzed how 200+ users are saving money with Multi-LLM Chat.

The biggest finding?

💰 Most people use GPT-4 when GPT-4o-mini would work fine.

Here's the cost difference:

Simple tasks (summaries, Q&A, basic coding):
- GPT-4 Turbo: $0.030 per request
- GPT-4o-mini: $0.0006 per request

That's 50x cheaper!

Over 1,000 requests/month:
- GPT-4 Turbo: $30
- GPT-4o-mini: $0.60

💡 How to Use Multi-LLM Chat to Optimize Costs

1. Ask the same question to multiple models
2. Compare quality of responses
3. Use the cheapest model that meets your needs
4. Track spending in real-time

Most users find that:
- Simple tasks: Use GPT-4o-mini or Gemini Flash (nearly free)
- Complex reasoning: Use Claude Sonnet
- Code generation: Use GPT-4o
- Creative writing: Compare all models
