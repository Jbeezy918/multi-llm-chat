## 💡 Why I Built This

I was tired of:
- Opening 4 tabs to compare AI models
- Wondering which model gives the best answer
- Overpaying for expensive models when cheaper ones work fine
- Not knowing my actual token costs

So I built the tool I wanted. Now I'm sharing it with you.

### First Comment (Post Immediately After Launching)
```
👋 Hey Product Hunt!

I'm Joe, and I built Multi-LLM Group Chat because I was spending too much time (and money) switching between different AI models.

**What makes this different:**

1. **Real Cost Tracking** - Most comparison tools don't show you the actual $ cost. This does.

2. **Free Option** - You can use 100% free local models via Ollama. No API keys needed.

3. **No Backend** - Your API keys never leave your browser. I can't see them, store them, or misuse them.

**What's coming next:**

- Streaming responses (requested by beta users)
- Side-by-side diff view
- Custom system prompts per model
- Team collaboration features

**I'd love your feedback on:**
- What models should I add next?
- What features would make you upgrade to premium?
- What's your biggest pain point when working with multiple LLMs?

Thanks for checking it out! 🚀

P.S. - It's open source. PRs welcome!

[Tool] I built Multi-LLM Group Chat - Compare GPT-4, Claude, Gemini & Llama side-by-side
```

Hey r/artificial!

I got tired of switching between ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini tabs to compare responses, so I built a tool that does it all in one place.

## What it does

Type one question → Get answers from all major AI models side-by-side:
- OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-3.5)
- Anthropic (Claude Sonnet, Opus, Haiku)
- Google (Gemini 2.0, 1.5)
- Ollama (free local models like Llama 3.2)

## Why I built it

1. **Stop tab-switching** - I was constantly opening 4 different AI chat windows
2. **Compare quality** - Sometimes Claude is better, sometimes GPT-4, depends on the task
3. **Track costs** - Shows you exactly how much each response costs in tokens/$$
4. **Optimize spending** - Find the cheapest model that still gives good results

## Features

- Real-time token cost tracking
- Conversation history & export
- Works with your own API keys (private, secure)
- Free option via Ollama (no API keys needed)
- Open source on GitHub

## Use cases I've found helpful

- **Prompt engineering** - Test prompts across models to see what works
- **Fact-checking** - Cross-reference answers from multiple AIs
- **Cost optimization** - Discover that GPT-3.5 is good enough for 80% of your queries
- **Learning** - See how different models approach the same problem

Try it here: [YOUR-URL]

Code: https://github.com/Jbeezy918/multi-llm-chat

**It's 100% free to use.** Bring your own API keys or use free local models.

Would love feedback! What features would make this more useful for you?

```
Tool to compare ChatGPT vs Claude vs Gemini side-by-side (with cost tracking)
```

**Post:**
```
Made a simple web app that lets you ask one question and see responses from GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and Llama all at once.

**Main features:**
- Side-by-side comparison
- Shows actual token costs per response
- Tracks total spending
- Save/export conversations
- Works with your own API keys

**Why this is useful:**
- Sometimes ChatGPT hallucinates but Claude gets it right
- Sometimes GPT-4 is overkill and GPT-3.5 is fine (and 10x cheaper)
- Good for testing which model is best for your specific use case

**Free to use:** [YOUR-URL]

**Open source:** https://github.com/Jbeezy918/multi-llm-chat

Feedback welcome! What would make this more useful?

### r/LocalLLaMA

**Title:**
```
[Tool] Compare local models (Ollama) vs GPT-4/Claude/Gemini in one interface
```

**Post:**
```
Built a comparison tool that works with Ollama for free local LLMs plus paid APIs.

**Supports:**
- Ollama (Llama 3.2, Mistral, Qwen, etc.) - 100% free
- OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-3.5) - if you have API key
- Claude (Sonnet, Opus, Haiku) - if you have API key
- Gemini (2.0 Flash, 1.5) - if you have API key

**Main use case:**
Compare local model quality vs paid APIs. See if your local Llama setup is "good enough" before spending $$ on GPT-4.

**Features:**
- One question → responses from all models
- Real token cost tracking (shows paid vs free)
- Save conversations
- No backend - runs in browser

**How it works with Ollama:**
1. Run `ollama serve`
2. Open the app
3. It auto-detects Ollama
4. Add paid API keys if you want (optional)
5. Compare responses

**Live demo:** [YOUR-URL]

**GitHub:** https://github.com/Jbeezy918/multi-llm-chat

Totally free. No tracking. No BS.

What local models should I prioritize adding?

**Post:**
```
I built a web app that lets you ask one question and get responses from multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Ollama) simultaneously.

Main features:
- Side-by-side comparison of GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and local models
- Real-time token cost tracking
- Bring your own API keys (or use free Ollama)
- Open source (Python/Streamlit)

Use cases:
- Testing prompts across models
- Finding the cheapest model that works for your task
- Cross-referencing answers for fact-checking
- Comparing local vs cloud model quality

The app runs in the browser. Your API keys stay client-side. No data is stored unless you explicitly save conversations.

Live demo: [YOUR-URL]
Code: https://github.com/Jbeezy918/multi-llm-chat

Built with Streamlit because I wanted to ship fast. Took ~2 hours start to finish.

Happy to answer questions about the implementation or take feature requests.

```
Thanks for the comparison! The main differences are:
1. Real-time cost tracking (most don't show this)
